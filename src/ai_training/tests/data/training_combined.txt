[do you like music] yes

[do you like music] no
nevermind

when the day is dawning on a texas sunday morning
is this the way to Amarillo

absolutely nothing
war what is it good for

you know what they say some things in life are bad
@TOPIC_OUT.montypython||always look on the bright side of life

we're no strangers to love you know the rules and so do I
never gonna give you up

i want to run i want to hide
where the streets have no name

@TOPIC_OUT.eagles||On a dark desert highway cool wind in my hair
hotel california

you can dance, you can jive, having the time of your life
dancing queen

if you see a faded sign at the end of the road that says
love shack

work it make it do it makes us
harder better faster stronger

when you were here before couldn't look you in the eye
creep
